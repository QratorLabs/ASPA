                This document defines a standard profile for Autonomous
                System Provider Authorization in the Resource Public Key
                Infrastructure. An Autonomous System Provider
                Authorization is a digitally signed object that provides
                a means of verifying that a Customer Autonomous System
                holder has authorized members of Provider set to be
                its upstream providers and for the Providers to send
                prefixes received from the Customer Autonomous System in
                all directions including providers and peers.

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
            <t>
                The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is to improve routing security.
                (See <xref target="RFC6480" /> for more information.)
                As part of this infrastructure, a mechanism is needed to verify that a AS has permission from a Customer AS (CAS) holder to send routes in all directions.
                The digitally signed Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) object provides this verification mechanism.
            </t>

            <t>
                The ASPA uses the template for RPKI digitally signed
                objects <xref target="RFC6488" />, which defines a
                Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref
                target="RFC5652" /> wrapper for the ASPA content as well
                as a generic validation procedure for RPKI signed
                objects.  As ASPAs need to be validated with RPKI
                certificates issued by the current infrastructure, we
                assume the mandatory-to-implement algorithms in <xref
                target="RFC6485" />, or its successor.
            </t>

		<t>To complete the specification of the ASPA (see
		Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6488"/>), this document
		defines:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>
                        The object identifier (OID) that identifies the ASPA signed object.
                        This OID appears in the eContentType field of the encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure).
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The ASN.1 syntax for the ASPA content, which is the payload signed by the CAS.
                        The ASPA content is encoded using the ASN.1 <xref target="X680"/> Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) <xref target="X690"/>.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The steps required to validate an ASPA beyond the validation steps specified in <xref target="RFC6488" />).
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>
                The content-type for an ASPA is defined as id-cct-ASPA, which has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD.

                This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo structure as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure (see <xref target="RFC6488" />).
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="The ASPA eContent" anchor="content">
            <t>
                The content of an ASPA identifies the Customer AS (CAS) as well as the Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) that are authorized to further propagate announcements received from the customer.
                If customer has multiple providers they MUST be registered in a single ASPA object.
                This rule is important to avoid possible race conditions during updates.
                An ASPA is formally defined as:

                While it's not restricted, but it's highly recommended maintaining for selected Customer AS a single ASPA object that covers all its providers.
                Such policy should prevent race conditions during ASPA updates that might affect prefix propagation.
                The software that provides hosting for ASPA records SHOULD support enforcement of this rule.
                In the case of the transition process between different CA registries, the ASPA records SHOULD be kept identical in all registries.
