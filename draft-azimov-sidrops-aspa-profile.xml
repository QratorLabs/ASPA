                This document defines a profile for the Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) object in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).
                An ASPA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of validating that a Customer Autonomous System (CAS) has authorized the members of a specified Provider AS set as its upstream provider(s) and/or connected Internet-exchange route server(s).

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
            <t>
                The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is to improve routing security <xref target="RFC6480" />.
                As part of this infrastructure, a mechanism is needed to facilitate holders of Autonomous System (AS) numbers in their capacity as Customer to authorize other ASes as their Provider(s).
                A Provider AS (PAS) is a network that:
                <list style="letters">
                  <t>offers its customers outbound (customer to Internet) data traffic connectivity and/or</t>
                  <t>further propagates in all directions (towards providers, lateral peers, and customers) any BGP Updates that the customer may send.</t>
                </list>
                The digitally signed Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) object described in this document provides the above-mentioned authorization mechanism.
            </t>
            <t>
                The ASPA object is a cryptographically signed attestation by a Customer AS (CAS) that another AS listed in the ASPA is a Provider.
                When the CAS has multiple Providers, all Provider ASes are listed in the ASPA including any internet exchange point (IXP) route server (RS) AS that serves the CAS.
            </t> 
            <t>
                The ASPA uses the template for RPKI digitally signed objects <xref target="RFC6488" />, which defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652" /> wrapper for the ASPA content as well as a generic validation procedure for RPKI signed objects.
                As ASPAs need to be validated with RPKI certificates issued by the current infrastructure, we assume the mandatory-to-implement algorithms in <xref target="RFC6485" />, or its successor.
            </t>

		<t>To complete the specification of the ASPA (see Section 4 of <xref target="RFC6488"/>), this document defines:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>
                        The object identifier (OID) that identifies the ASPA signed object.
                        This OID appears in the eContentType field of the encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The ASN.1 syntax for the ASPA content, which is the payload signed by the CAS.
                        The ASPA content is encoded using the ASN.1 <xref target="X680"/> Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) <xref target="X690"/>.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The steps required to validate an ASPA beyond the validation steps specified in <xref target="RFC6488" />.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="ASPA Content Type" anchor="content-type">
            <t>
                The content-type for an ASPA is defined as id-ct-ASPA, which has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.49.

                This OID MUST appear both within the eContentType in the encapContentInfo structure as well as the content-type signed attribute within the signerInfo structure (see <xref target="RFC6488" />).
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="ASPA eContent" anchor="content">
            <t>

                The content of an ASPA identifies the Customer AS (CAS) as well as the Set of Provider ASes (SPAS) that are authorized by the CAS to be its Providers.
            </t>
            <t>
                Not all route servers (RS) at internet exchange points are transparent, e.g., in some cases the AS number of the RS would be present in the AS_PATH.
                In this case, the RS AS is acting as a provider AS, which propagates routes between its clients (i.e., customers).
                Thus, a CAS MUST add both upstream providers and any connected non-transparent RS AS to its SPAS.
            </t>
            <t>
                If a Customer AS is connected to multiple transit providers/non-transparent route servers, all Provider ASes MUST be registered in a single ASPA object.
                This rule is important to avoid possible race conditions during updates of ASPAs.
            </t>
            <t>
                The eContent of an ASPA is an instance of ASProviderAttestation, formally defined by the following ASN.1 <xref target="X680"/> module:
            </t>
		
            <sourcecode type="asn.1" src="RPKI-ASPA-2022.asn"/>

            <t>
                Note that this content appears as the eContent within the encapContentInfo as specified in <xref target="RFC6488" />.
            </t>

            <section title="version">
                <t>
                    The version number of the ASProviderAttestation MUST be v0.

            <section title="customerASID">
                <t>
                    The customerASID field contains the AS number of the Customer Autonomous System that is the authorizing entity.

            <section title="providers">
                <t>
                    The providers field contains the listing of ASes that are authorized as providers or route servers in the specified address family.

                <t>
                    Each element contained in the providers field is an instance of ProviderAS.

                <t>
                    In addition to the constraints described by the formal ASN.1 definition, the contents of the providers field MUST satisfy the following constraints:
                  <list style="symbols">
                    <t>

                        The elements of providers MUST be ordered in ascending numerical order by the value of the providerASID field.

                    <t>
                        Each value of providerASID MUST be unique (with respect to the other elements of providers).
                    </t>

                        <t>
                            The providerASID field contains the AS number of an AS that has been authorized by the customer AS as its provider or RS in the specified address family.

                        <t>
                            If present, it contains the two-octet Address Family Identifier (AFI) for which the relation between the customer and provider is authorized.
                            This specification only supports IPv4 and IPv6.
                            Therefore, the value MUST be either 0001 or 0002, as specified in the Address Family Numbers registry <xref target="IANA-AF"/> maintained by IANA.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            If omitted, the authorization is valid for both IPv4 and IPv6 announcements.

            <t>
                While it is not required, it is highly recommended that for a selected Customer AS a single ASPA object be maintained that covers all connected providers/route servers.
                [Sriram note: This differs normatively from what was previously stated in Section 3: "If customer is connected to multiple transit providers/non-transparent route servers they MUST be registered in a single ASPA object." Note the MUST that was used before. Also, is it necessary to say this and the next sentence twice in the document as it was all said already in Section 3.] 
                Such policy should prevent race conditions during ASPA updates that might affect prefix propagation.
                The software that provides hosting for ASPA records SHOULD support enforcement of this rule.
                In the case of the transition process between different CA registries, the ASPA records SHOULD be kept identical in all registries in terms of their authorization contents.
