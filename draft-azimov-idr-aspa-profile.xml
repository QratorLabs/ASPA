     <t>
       This document defines a standard profile for Autonomouse System Provider Authorization (ASPAs). An ASPA is a
       digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that Autonomous System (AS) holder has authorized an
       Provider Autonomous System (PAS) to be its upstream provider and sent recieved prefixes from AS in all
       directions including providers and peers.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
        <t>
            The primary purpose of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is to improve routing security. (See
            [RFC6480] for more information.)  As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to allow entities to verify that
            an PAS has been given permission by AS holder to send routes in all directions. A ASPA provides this function.
        </t>

        <t>
            The ASPA makes use of the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488], which defines a Crytopgraphic
            Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] wrapper for the ASPA content as well as a generic validation procedure for RPKI
            signed objects.  Therefore, to complete the specification of the ROA (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]), this
            document defines:
        </t>

        <t>
            The ASPA makes use of the template for RPKI digitally signed objects [RFC6488], which defines a Crytopgraphic
            Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] wrapper for the ASPA content as well as a generic validation procedure for RPKI
            signed objects.  Therefore, to complete the specification of the ROA (see Section 4 of [RFC6488]), this
            document defines:
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    The OID that identifies the signed object as being a ASPA. (This OID appears within the eContentType
                    in the encapContentInfo object as well as the content-type signed attribute in the signerInfo object).
                </t>
            </list>

        </t>


        <t>

        </t>



      2. The ASN.1 syntax for the ROA eContent.  (This is the payload
         that specifies the AS being authorized to originate routes as
         well as the prefixes to which the AS may originate routes.)
         The ROA eContent is ASN.1 encoded using the Distinguished
         Encoding Rules (DER) [X.690].

      3. An additional step required to validate ROAs (in addition to
         the validation steps specified in [RFC6488]).
