        <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
            <t>
                The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was designed with no mechanisms to authenticate BGP attributes.
                Two consequences are BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks <xref target="RFC7908" />.
                BGP extensions are able to partially solve these problems.
                For example, ROA-based Origin Validation <xref target="RFC6483" /> can be used to detect and filter accidental mis-originations, and <xref target="I-D.ymbk-idr-bgp-eotr-policy" /> can be used to detect accidental route leaks.
                While these upgrades to BGP are quite useful, they still rely on BGP transitive attributes, especially AS_PATH, that can be manipulated by attackers.
            </t>
            <t>
                BGPSec <xref target="RFC8205" /> ws designed to solve the problem of AS_PATH correctness.
                But ignoring the complexity of this extension, it has backward support for 'old' BGP-4 that an attacker can use in a downgrade attack to nullify all the work of AS_PATH signing.
                As a result, to abuse the AS_PATH or any other transit attribute, an attacker merely needs to downgrade 'old' BGP-4.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document defines the semantics of Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to authenticate the AS_PATH attribute of routes advertised in BGP.
                It specifies AS_PATH authentication procedures to allow a BGP listener to detect and mitigate malicious hijacks and route leaks.
            </t>

        <section title="Autonomous System Provider Authorization" anchor="ASPA">
            <t>
                As described in <xref target="RFC6480" />, the RPKI is based on a hierarchy of resource certificates that are aligned to the Internet Number Resource allocation structure.
                Resource certificates are X.509 certificates  that conform to the PKIX profile <xref target="RFC5280" />, and to the extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers <xref target="RFC3779" />.
                A resource certificate is a binding by an issuer of IP address blocks and Autonomous System (AS) numbers to the subject of a certificate, identified by the unique association of the subject's private key with the public key contained in the resource certificate.
                The RPKI is structured so that each current resource certificate matches a current resource allocation or assignment.
            </t>

            <t>
                ASPAs are digitally signed objects that bind a Provider AS number to a Customer AS number (in terms of BGP announcements not business), and are signed by the holder of the Customer AS.
                The ASPA provides is an attestation that a Customer AS holder has authorized a particular Provider AS to propagate the Customer's announcements onward, e.g. to the Provider's upstream providers or peers.
                The ASPA record profile is described in [#link].  The ASPA mechanism combined with BGP Roles <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy" /> and ROA-based Origin Validation <xref target="RFC6483" /> provide a fully automated solution to detect and filter hijacks and route leaks, including malicious ones.
            </t>

        <section title="Anomaly Propagation" anchor="propagation">
            <t>
                Both route leaks and hijacks have similar effects on ISP operations - they redirect traffic, resulting in increased latency, packet loss, or possible MiTM attacks.
                But the level of risk depends significantly on the propagation of such BGP anomalies.
                For an example, a hijack that is propagated only to customers may concentrate traffic inn a particular ISP's customer cone; while if the anomaly is propagated through peers, upstreams, or reaches Tier1 networks, thus distributing globally, traffic may be redirected at the level of entire countries and/or global providers.
            </t>
            <t>
                The ability to constrain propagation of BGP anomalies to upstreams and peers, without requiring support from the source of the anomaly (which is critical if source has malicious intent), should significantly improve the security of inter-domain routing and solve the majority of problems.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Customer-Provider Authentication Procedure" anchor="pair-validation">
            <t>
                A relying party (RP) must have access to a local cache of the complete set of cryptographically valid ASPAs when performing authentication of a received AS_PATH.
                The receiver of an announcement matches the AS_PATH to one or more valid ASPAs in order to authenticate the last hops of thre AS_PATH, which, in turn, can determine the appropriate local actions to take on the received annpuncement.
            </t>


            <t>
                For an ordered pair of ASNs in an AS_PATH (AS1, AS2), the customer-provider authentication state is determined as follows:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>
                        Select all cryptographically valid ASPAs with a customer value of AS2.
                        This selection forms the set of "candidate ASPAs."
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If the set of candidate ASPAs is empty, then the procedure exits with an outcome of "unknown."
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If is at least one candidate ASPA where the provider field is AS 0, and the announcement is from a provider or a peer, then the procedure exits with an outcome of "invalid."
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If there is at least one candidate ASPA where the provider field is AS1, then the procedure exits with an outcome of "valid."
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Otherwise, the procedure exits with an outcome of "invalid."
                    </t>
                </list>

            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="AS_PATH Validation">
            <t>
                The AS_PATH attribute identifies the autonomous systems through which an UPDATE message has passed.
                The components of this list can be AS_SETs or AS_SEQes, as defined in <xref target="RFC4271" />.
            </t>
            <t>
                The value of each AS_SEQ component can be described as set of pairs {(AS(I), prepend(I)), (AS(I-1), prepend(I-1))...).
                We can state that when a route is received from a customer or a literal peer, each pair (AS(I-1), AS(i)) MUST have customer-provider or sibling relation. If the are other types of relations, it means that the route was leaked or the AS_PATH attribute was malformed.
                The goal of above procedure is to check correctness of this statement.
            </t>

            <t>
                If a route is received from a customer or peer, its AS_PATH MUST be validated as follows:
                <list style="numbers">
                    <t>
                        If the closest ASN in the AS_PATH is not the receiver's neighbor ASN then procedure halts with outcome "invalid;"
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If in one of AS_SEQ segments there is an invalid customer-provider pair (AS(I-1), AS(i)) (<xref target="pair-validation" />) then the procedure halts with outcome "invalid;"
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        If the AS_PATH has at least one AS_SET segment then procedure halts with outcome "as_set;"
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Otherwise, the procedure halts with an outcome of "valid."
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                If the output of the AS_PATH validation procedure is "invalid" the LOCAL_PREF SHOULD be set to 0 or the route MAY be dropped.
                If an "invalid" route has no alternative routes and it is propagated to other ASNs despite the above, it MUST be marked with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN community to avoid possible stable oscillations, when an unchecked route received from a provider becomes preferred over an invalid route received from a customer.
                This also allows customers to detect malformed routes received from upstream providers.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the output of AS_PATH validation procedure is 'as_set' it means that AS_PATH can't be fully validated.
                Such routes should be treated with caution and MAY be processed the same way as "invalid" routes.
            </t>
            <t>
                The above AS_PATH validation procedure can be fully automated using BGP Roles.  [ DESCRIBE HOW ]

        <section title="Disavowal of Provider Authorizaion">
            <t>
                An ASPA is a positive attestation that an ASN holder has authorized its provider to redistribute received routes to the provider's providers and peers.
                This does not preclude the provider AS from redistribution to its other customers.
                By creating an ASPA where the provider AS is 0, the customer indicates that no provider should further announce its routes.  Specifically, AS 0 is reserved to identify provider-free networks, Internet exchange meshes, etc.
            </t>

            <t>
                An ASPA with a provider AS of 0 is an statement by the customer AS that the its routes should not be received by any relying party AS from any of its customers or peers.
            </t>
            <t>
                By convention, an ASPA with a provider AS of 0 should be the only ASPA issued by a given AS holder; although this is not a strict requirement.
                A provider 0 ASPA may coexist with ASPAs that have different provider AS values; though in such cases, the presence or absence of the provider AS 0 ASPA does not alter the AS_PATH validity state.  [ NEEDS CLARIFICATION ]
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Siblings (Complex Relations)" anchor="Siblings">
            <t>
                There are AS relationships which can not be described as strictly simple peer-peer or customer-provider; e.g. when both parties are intentionally sending prefixes received from each other to their peers and/or upstreams.
            </t>

            <t>
                In this case, two symmetric ASPAs records {(AS1, AS2), (AS2, AS1)} must be created by AS1 and AS2 respectively.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                ASPA issuers should be aware of the validation implication in issuing an ASPA - an ASPA implicitly invalidates all routes passed to upstream providers other than the provider ASs listed in the collection of ASPAs.
                It is the Customer AS's duty to maintain a correct set of ASPAs.
            </t>

            <t>
                While the ASPA provides a check of AS_PATH validity for routes received from customers and peers, it doesn't provide full support for routes that are received from upstream providers.
                So, this mechanism guarantees detection of both malicious and accidental route leaks and provides partial support for detection of malicious hijacks: upstream transit ISPs will still be able to send hijacked prefixes with malformed AS_PATHs to their customers.
