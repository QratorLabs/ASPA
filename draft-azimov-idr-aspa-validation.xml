            The BGP was designed without any mechanisms that can guarantee the validity of BGP attributes. The
            outcome of this limitations are BGP Hijacks and BGP Route Leaks [#link]. BGP extensions are able to
            partially solve these problems. For example, RPKI can be used to detect and filter leaked static routes,
            and [link to open policy/eOTC] can be used to detect mistake route leaks type [#link]. While these upgrades
            are quite useful, they still rely on BGP transit attributes, especially AS_PATH, that can be also violated
            by attackers.
        </t>
        <t>
            It is believed that BGPSec [#link] can solve problem of AS_PATH validation. But even ignoring
            overcomplexity of this BGP extension, it has backward support for 'old' BGP that nullifies all work with
            signatures. As a result, to keep violating AS_PATH or any other transit attribute, an attacker just need to
            use 'old' BGP.

            This document defines the semantics of a Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) in terms of the
            context of an application of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure to validate the AS_PATH attribute of
            routes advertised in the Border Gateway Protocol. This documents specifies AS_PATH validation procedure
            which allows to detect and mitigate malicious hijacks and route leaks.

    <section title="Autonomous System Provider Authorization" anchor="ASPA">
        <t>
           The RPKI is based on a hierarchy of resource certificates that are aligned to the Internet Number
           Resource allocation structure. Resource certificates are X.509 certificates that conform to the PKIX
           profile [RFC5280], and to the extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers [RFC3779]. A resource
           certificate describes an action by an issuer that binds a list of IP address blocks and Autonomous System
           (AS) numbers to the subject of a certificate, identified by the unique association of the subject's
           private key with the public key contained in the resource certificate.  The RPKI is structured such that
           each current resource certificate matches a current resource allocation or assignment.  This is further
           described in [RFC6480].
        </t>

        <t>
           ASPAs are digitally signed objects that bind a provider AS number to a customer AS number, and are signed by
           the holder of customer AS. ASPA provides a means of verifying that an AS holder has authorized a
           particular provider AS to send routes in all directions, including upper upstream providers or peers.
           ASPAs are described in [#link]. ASPAs are intended to fit within the requirements for adding security to
           inter-domain routing and give an opportunity to detect and filter malicious hijacks and route leaks.

    </section>

    <section title="Customer-Provider Validation Procedure" anchor="pair-validation">
        <t>
            It is assumed here that a relying party (RP) has access to a local cache of the complete set of valid
            ASPAs when performing validation of an AS_PATH. The RP needs to match a AS_PATH to one or more valid ASPAs
            in order to determine a validation outcome, which, in turn, can be used to determine the appropriate
            local actions to perform on the route.
        </t>


        <t> For a pair (AS1, AS2) customer-provider validity state is defined by the following procedure:
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    Select all valid ASPAs with customer value equal to AS2. This selection forms the set of "candidate
                    ASPAs".
                </t>
                <t>
                    If the set of candidate ASPAs is empty, then the procedure stops with an outcome of "unknown"
                    (or, synonymously, "not found", as used in [BGP-PFX]).
                </t>
                <t>
                    If there is ASPAs in the list of candidate ASPAs where provider field equals to AS1, then the
                    procedure halts with an outcome of "valid".
                </t>
                <t>
                    Otherwise, the procedure halts with an outcome of "invalid".
                </t>
            </list>
            
        </t>
    </section>
    
    <section title="AS_PATH Validation">
        <t>
            AS_PATH attribute identifies the autonomous systems through which routing information in
            UPDATE message has passed. The components of this list can be AS_SETs or AS_SEQes, as defined in
            [RFC4271]. When route is received from customer or literal peer SHOULD have in its AS_SEQ
            components only customer-provider pairs. If it has other types of pairs, it does mean that this route was
            leaked or AS_PATH attribute was malformed. In this case such route must be dropped. It's also important
            to highlight that routes that have AS_SET components in AS_PATH can't be fully validated and should be
            treated with caution.
        </t>

        <t> If route is received from customer or peer it MUST validate AS_PATH attribute using following criteria:
            <list style="numbers">
                <t>
                    If the left ASN in AS_PATH isn't equal to it's neighbor ASN, route MUST be dropped.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If AS_PATH has invalid pair of ASNs, such route MUST be dropped;
                </t>
                <t>
                    If AS_PATH have at least one AS_SET component, set LOCAL_PREF to pref_set;
                </t>
                <t>
                    If AS_PATH doesn't have AS_SET components in AS_PATH but have at least one unknown pair of ASNs
                    set LOCAL_REF to pref_unknown;
                </t>
                <t>
                    Otherwise - set LOCAL_PREF to pref_valid.
                </t>
            </list>
            These local preference values MUST have next order: pref_set &lt; pref_unknown &lt;= pref_valid.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Disavowal of Provider Authorizaion">
        <t>
            A ASPA is a positive attestation that a ASN holder has authorized its provider to redistribute received
            routes to its providers and peers. It is possible for a ASN holder to construct an authorization where no
            valid AS has been granted any such authority.  This is achieved by using a ASPA where the ASPA's subject
            provider ASN is one that must not be used in any routing context.  Specifically, AS 0 is reserved by the
            IANA such that it may be used to identify Tier1 networks and IXes.
        </t>

        <t>
            A ASPA with a subject of provider AS 0 is an attestation by the holder of customer AS that the its routes
            should not be received from any customer or peer.
        </t>
        <t>
            By convention, an provider AS 0 ASPA should be the only ASPA issued by a given AS holder; although
            this is not a strict requirement.  An provider 0 ASPA may coexist with ASPAs that have different subject
            provider AS  values; although in such cases, the presence or lack of presence of the provider AS 0 ASPA does
            not alter the AS_PATH validity state in any way.
